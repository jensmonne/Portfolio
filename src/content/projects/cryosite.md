## The story
A co-op VR shooter set deep in the frozen Arctic wilderness.

An abandoned research facility, long sealed, long forgotten has begun emitting strange signals. Missing teams. Unknown activity. Rumors of something… alive.

You and your squad are deployed on a one-way mission: infiltrate the facility and destroy it at any cost. Some say a prototype device capable of wiping the entire structure sits somewhere on the top floor. Others say no one who ever reached it came back.

Fight through freezing corridors, hostile experiments, and whatever still roams the dark. Survive together, or die alone. Will you be able to complete this impossible mission?

## The Challenge
Working with a team of 4 artists and developers, we were tasked with creating a VR shooter with a futuristic theme. We also added multiplayer support, allowing players to join and play together in real-time.

We faced challenges such as synchronizing player movements across multiple devices and implementing AI behaviors for enemies. We also had to ensure that the game was optimized for performance and that the multiplayer experience was smooth and enjoyable.

## Tech Stack
- **Unity** for the core engine.
- **Meta Quest 3** for VR hardware.
- **Mirror** for multiplayer networking.
