## Overview
This homelab serves as my personal playground for self-hosting services, experimenting with containerization, and improving my DevOps skills.
It is designed to be modular, reproducible, and easy to maintain.

## Architecture
The homelab runs on 2 Raspberry Pi's and uses Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple services. Each service is isolated in its own container and communicates over a shared internal network.

## The Challenge
Building a containerized environment for personal use.

## Tech Stack
- **Docker** for containerization.
